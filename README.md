# CommonsPub Federated Server 

## About the project
[CommonsPub](http://commonspub.org) is a project to create a generic federated server, based on the `ActivityPub` and `ActivityStreams` web standards). 

This is the back-end, written in Elixir (running on the Erlang VM, and using the Phoenix web framework). 
The federation API uses [ActivityPub](http://activitypub.rocks/) 
The client API uses GraphQL. 
The front-end is built with React (in a [seperate repo](https://gitlab.com/CommonsPub/Client).

This codebase was forked from [MoodleNet](http://moodle.net/), which was originally forked from [Pleroma](https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma).
