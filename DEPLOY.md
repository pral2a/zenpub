# Backend Configuration and Deployment

*These instructions are for setting up the **MoodleNet backend** alone in production. You probably want to start with the following two guides, and only refer back to this document for some more advanced things you might not find in those guides.* 

- *You probably want to deploy the **MoodleNet frontend and backend together**, in which case please refer to our guide to [Deploying MoodleNet](https://gitlab.com/moodlenet/clients/react/blob/develop/README.md#deploying-moodlenet)!*

- *If you want to run the MoodleNet backend in development, please refer to our [Developer FAQ](https://gitlab.com/moodlenet/servers/federated/blob/develop/HACKING.md)!*

## Step 0 - Configure your database

You must provide a postgresql database for moodlenet data storage. We
require postgres 9.4 or above.

If you are running in a restricted environment such as Amazon RDS, you
will need to execute some sql against the database:

```
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS citext;
```

## Step 1 - Configure the backend

MoodleNet needs some environment variables to be configured in order to work (a list of which can be found in the file `config/docker.env` in this same repository).

In the `config/` directory, there are following default config files:

* `config.exs`: default base configuration
* `dev.exs`: default extra configuration for `MIX_ENV=dev`
* `prod.exs`: default extra configuration for `MIX_ENV=prod`

Do NOT modify the files above. Instead, overload any settings from the above files using env variables (a list of which can be found in the file `config/docker.env` in this same repository), or if necessary by editing the following files:

* `dev.secret.exs`: custom extra configuration for `MIX_ENV=dev`
* `prod.secret.exs`: custom extra configuration for `MIX_ENV=prod`


`MAIL_DOMAIN` and `MAIL_KEY` are needed to configure transactional email, sign up at [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) and then configure the domain name and key.

## Step 2 - Install

---

### Option A - Install using Docker containers (recommended)

A pre-built docker image can be found at: https://hub.docker.com/r/moodlenet/moodlenet/

The easiest way to launch the docker image is using the `docker-compose` tool.
The `docker-compose.yml` uses `config/docker.env` to launch a `moodlenet` container along with its dependencies, currently that means an extra postgres container. You may want to add a webserver / reverse proxy yourself.

#### Install with docker-compose

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), a recent [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose) (which supports v3 configs), and [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed:

```sh
$ docker version
Docker version 18.09.1-ce

$ docker-compose -v                                                                                                        
docker-compose version 1.23.2

$ make --version
GNU Make 4.2.1
...
```

2. Clone this repository and change into the directory:

```sh
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/moodlenet/servers/federated.git moodlenet-backend
$ cd moodlenet-backend
```

3. Build the docker image.

**Skip this step if you want to use the pre-built image provided by MoodleNet on Docker cloud instead.**

```

$ make build

$ make tag_latest
```

4. Start the docker containers with docker-compose:

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

5. The backend should now be running at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).

6. If that worked, start the app as a daemon next time:

```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
```

#### Docker commands

* `docker-compose up` launches the service, by default at the port 4000.
* `docker-compose run --rm backend bin/moodle_net` returns all the possible commands
* `docker-compose run --rm backend /bin/sh` runs a simple shell inside of the container, useful to explore the image
* `docker-compose run --rm backend bin/moodle_net start_iex` starts a new `iex` console
* `docker-compose run backend bin/moodle_net remote` runs an `iex` console when the service is already running.

There are some useful release tasks under `MoodleNet.ReleaseTasks.` that can be run in an `iex` console:

- `create_db` starts the app, creates the DB, and stops 
- `create_repos` creates the DB on already running app
- `drop_db` starts the app, deletes the DB, and stops  
- `drop_repos` deletes the DB 
- `empty_db` starts the app, runs all down migrations, and stops  
- `empty_repos` runs all down migrations
- `migrate_db` starts the app, runs all up migrations, and stops 
- `migrate_repos` runs all up migrations
- `rollback_db` rolls back the previous migration

For example: 
`iex> MoodleNet.ReleaseTasks.create_db` to create your database if it doesn't already exist.


#### Building a Docker image

The [Dockerfile](https://gitlab.com/moodlenet/servers/federated/blob/develop/Dockerfile) uses the [multistage build](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) feature to make the image as small as possible. It is a very common release using OTP releases. It generates the release which is later copied into the final image.

There is a `Makefile` with two commands:

* `make build` which builds the docker image in `moodlenet:latest` and `moodlenet:$VERSION-$BUILD`
* `make run` which can be used to run the docker built docker image without `docker-compose`

---

### Option B - Manual installation without Docker

#### Dependencies

* Postgres version 9.6 or newer
* Build tools
* Elixir version 1.9.0 with OTP 22 (or possibly newer). If your distribution only has an old version available, check [Elixir's install page](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) or use a tool like [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) (run `asdf install` in this directory).

#### Quickstart

The quick way to get started with building a release, assuming that elixir and erlang are already installed.

```bash
$ export MIX_ENV=prod
$ mix deps.get
$ mix release
# TODO: load required env variables
$ _build/prod/rel/moodle_net/bin/moodle_net eval 'MoodleNet.ReleaseTasks.create_db()'
# DB created
$ _build/prod/rel/moodle_net/bin/moodle_net eval 'MoodleNet.ReleaseTasks.migrate_db()'
# DB migrated
$ _build/prod/rel/moodle_net/bin/moodle_net start
# App started in foreground
```

See the section on [Runtime Configuration](#runtime-configuration) for information on exporting environment variables.

#### B-1. Building the release

* Clone this repo.
* Make sure you have erlang and elixir installed (check `Dockerfile` for what version we're currently using)
* Run `mix deps.get` to install elixir dependencies.
* From here on out, you may want to consider what your `MIX_ENV` is set to. For production, ensure that you either export `MIX_ENV=prod` or use it for each command. Continuing, we are assuming `MIX_ENV=prod`.
* Run `mix release` to create an elixir release. This will create an executable in your `_build/prod/rel/moodle_net` directory. We will be using the `bin/moodle_net` executable from here on.

#### B-2. Running the release

* Export all required environment variables. See [Runtime Configuration](#runtime-configuration) section.

* Create a database, if one is not created already with `bin/moodle_net eval 'MoodleNet.ReleaseTasks.create_db()'`.
* You will likely also want to run the migrations. This is done similarly with `bin/moodle_net eval 'MoodleNet.ReleaseTasks.migrate_db()'`.
* If youâ€™re using RDS or some other locked down DB, you may need to run     `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS citext WITH SCHEMA public;` on your database with elevated privileges.


* You can check if your instance is configured correctly by running it with `moodle_net start` 

* To run the instance as a daemon, use `bin/moodle_net daemon`.

#### B-3. Adding HTTPS

The common and convenient way for adding HTTPS is by using Nginx or Caddyserver as a reverse proxy. 

Caddyserver handles generating and setting up HTTPS certificates automatically, but if you need TLS/SSL certificates for nginx, you can look get some for free with [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). The simplest way to obtain and install a certificate is to use [Certbot.](https://certbot.eff.org). Depending on your specific setup, certbot may be able to get a certificate and configure your web server automatically.
  
#### Runtime configuration

You will need to load the required environment variables for the release to run properly. 

See [`config/releases.exs`](config/releases.exs) for all used variables. Consider also viewing there [`config/docker.env`](config/docker.env) file for some examples of values.

## Step 3 - Run

By default, the backend listens on port 4000 (TCP), so you can access it on http://localhost:4000/ (if you are on the same machine). In case of an error it will restart automatically.

The MoodleNet frontend is a seperate app: https://gitlab.com/moodlenet/clients/react
